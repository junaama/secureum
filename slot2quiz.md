1 - A, B, C, D : No way theyre all correct :sob:
2 - A, B Not D, bc it's not <=
**3** - B, C Not D bc an Enum can be immutable, unless I'm misremembering an Enum as a value type
**4** - A, B Not sure if they can be recursive
5 - A - Changed from B to A
6 - D Unsure. Still unsure. Reflection: Was right to be unsure lol
**7** - A, B, Unsure about C/D I believe that's for functions overall not events? Reflection: Indexing is for events, yes...
*8* - A, B, D Reflection: Didn't really remember what coinbase tx did
*9* - A, B, D Unsure on D. Added A.
10 - A, B. Solidified B. Reflection: Glanced over Contract and didn't remember
*11* - A, B, D  Reflection: Thought it always defaulted to zero, but alas
*12* - B Reflection: Was mainly thrown off by uint160. Don't remember reading about address conversions but with a closer look, uint160 makes so much sense. 
13 - A, B, D
*14* - A, Revisit Reflection: Think I was just unsure here
15 - A, B, C No longer unsure.
16 - D

**20** - A Unsure here. Reflection: RIP my mind
21 - A,B,C
*22* - A, C Reflection: Shouldve known this tbh
*23 *- B, Reflection: My answer had a trailing comma for a reason... I've seen mapping inits in fn params so I was misled to think it could have memory too
**24** - A, B Reflection: Ack. I even removed D, curse of a test-taker
**25** - A, C, D. Feels tricky! Reflection: Tricky indeed it was, key thing here is the irrespective of types statement
**26** - B, C, D Added D Reflection: Shouldnt have added anything lul
*27* - C, i dont think blockhash is a function Reflection: My pea brain thought the current knowledge was past block based not current. Pea brain.

29 - A, C,D Still unsure on C.
*30* - A, Removed my maybe on C Reflection: Ack! Shouldve kept it 
31 - A Still unsure here Reflection: I need to understand calls more!
