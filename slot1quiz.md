12 - B Note: A is wrong, unused gas is sent to the tx sender account.
13 - B Note: Forgot what volatility meant in this context.

15 - A Rationalizing: Can't get current block number as transaction hasn't processed for current block? D is definitely correct so going with D here. Well the EVM can access the code hash of other accounts too, so maybe it's not correct. Misread the question so we are looking for false statements. Switching rationale. EVM should be able to get both the code hash and balance from the current account. It must be about the block. SO A/B
16 - B Note: Can't access the logs. I think
17 - A 
18 -  C Rationalizing: SSTORE is 20000/5000 I believe. CREATE is large too. It's CREATE vs SSTORE...
19 - D Rationale: The tx would revert which would not have T1 writing to S1 or S2 at all. It's all or nothing.
20 - D
21 - Honestly do not know. Need to revisit this topic.
22 - B makes the most sense, but need to revisit this topic. Not sold.
